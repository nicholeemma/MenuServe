Feedback from a student named Yue Yin

1. In the page of menu, listing the names of cuisine will be better
2. In the page of menu, the current two buttons to register and log in are not clear. Replacing them with one button "registration/login"
3. The types of order status can be reduced to pending and completed. Add a column for recording the dest number.
4. As there are classifications of menus in the page of menus, manager-menu should have column of classification as well
5. Make incline CSS into external files.
