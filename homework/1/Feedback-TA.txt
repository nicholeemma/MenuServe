Feedback from TA- Steven

1. On the menu page, how can a user see the price of an item? Maybe show price under the image or have a tooltip pop up when hovering over the image.
2. On the Submitted Orders page, what is the "Name of cuisine" column? Is it a single item, if so, shouldn't users be able to order multiple different cuisines in one order?
3. On the Submitted Orders page and page where the manager can manage employees, can the employee/manager change which store they are viewing?

My according answer

1. I will make a function when the mouse moves over the picture, the price will show up.
2. I will make one more column for the amount of cuisine in an order.
3. I will make a selection button for changing the store.
