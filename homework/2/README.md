## Choose GET method
According to the requirement " This extra data should not beÂ  visible to the user in your UI or in the page URL.", I chose to use POST method.
Because the GET method is insecure and will show the data in the url which the user entered.
POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history

## Logic of calculation
The same as requirements
Additional:
1. If user enters "9+2=", the calculation will display "9 9 2 11". After that the calculation is over. New entered number will be treated as a new calcualtion. Once pressed "=", the calculation renders the result, calculation is over.
2. When the user pressed a "=" in the middle of a series of numbers, the "=" will be ignored.
3. A new calcution will be started until a number entered.
