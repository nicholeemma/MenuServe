To turn in homework 2, create files (and subdirectories if needed) in
this directory, add and commit those files to your cloned repository,
and push your commit to your bare repository on GitHub.

Add any general notes or instructions for the TAs to this README file.
The TAs will read this file before evaluating your work.

##Choose GET method
According to the requirement " This extra data should not beÂ  visible to the user in your UI or in the page URL.", I chose to use POST method.
Because the GET method is insecure and will show the data in the url which the user entered.
POST is a little safer than GET because the parameters are not stored in browser history
