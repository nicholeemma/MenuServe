### MenuServe design process (20/20)
### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS
#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (19/20)

-1, It is not clear how to delete a menu item from your menu management page.

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (15/20)

-3, You should avoid in-line styling (e.g. `style="..."` in tags) when possible. Using CSS rules instead will make it easier to find and apply styling changes to your pages.

-1, You should have `<title>` tags for each page, which should contain a short textual description of what page the user is actually on. For instance, a login page could be titled 'MenuServe - Login'.

-1, There are validation errors in your MenuServe HTML. High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.

-0.1, There are validation errors in your MenuServe CSS. High-quality CSS should always be validated using [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] to ensure that it meets the CSS standards.

-0.1, Ideally you should indent your HTML code properly so that nested tags are one indentation level further than their parents, as this will improve readability of your code.

### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (10/10)
### Additional feedback

-0, It would be easier for you to iterate on your wireframes first and then start coding instead of making iterations on code.

-0, Ideally `src` folder should not be put into `wireframes` folder. They are separate and should be in the same level.
