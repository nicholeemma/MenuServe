### MenuServe design process (15/20)

-5, Evidence of design iteration is missing from your submission. After receiving feedback, you should have revised your design and submitted the edited wireframes alongside the originals. Plus, I couldn't find some of the corresponding feedbacks based on your original wireframes. For example, one student gave you feedback "In the page of menu, the current two buttons to register and log in are not clear. Replacing them with one button "registration/login", but I didn't find such buttons in your original wireframes.

### Demonstrates basic familiarity with HTML and CSS
#### Completeness: Solution meets basic specification (19/20)

-1, It is not clear how to delete a menu item from your menu management page.

#### Demonstrates understanding of HTML/CSS (15/20)

-3, You should avoid in-line styling (e.g. `style="..."` in tags) when possible. Using CSS rules instead will make it easier to find and apply styling changes to your pages.

-1, You should have `<title>` tags for each page, which should contain a short textual description of what page the user is actually on. For instance, a login page could be titled 'MenuServe - Login'.

-1, There are validation errors in your MenuServe HTML. High-quality HTML should always be validated using [https://validator.w3.org/] to ensure that it meets the HTML standards.

-0.1, There are validation errors in your MenuServe CSS. High-quality CSS should always be validated using [https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/] to ensure that it meets the CSS standards.

-0.1, Ideally you should indent your HTML code properly so that nested tags are one indentation level further than their parents, as this will improve readability of your code.

### Appropriate use of course infrastructure and Git (10/10)
### Additional feedback

-0, It would be easier for you to iterate on your wireframes first and then start coding instead of making iterations on code.

-0, Ideally `src` folder should not be put into `wireframes` folder. They are separate and should be in the same level.
